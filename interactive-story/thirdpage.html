<p>Libby, as she would soon be named, was one of nearly 250 dogs and cats rescued last fall from animal testing hellhole Professional Laboratory and Research Services, Inc. after it shut down following a PETA investigation. Pharmaceutical companies paid the laboratory to infest dogs and cats with worms, fleas, and ticks and then force-feed them or smear their skin with toxic chemicals in tests for companion-animal products. Our investigator recorded workers as they kicked, threw, and dragged dogs; lifted puppies by their throats; and screamed obscenities at animals. A former supervisor and three former employees of the laboratory were indicted on felony cruelty charges.</p>
