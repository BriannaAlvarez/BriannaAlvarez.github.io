                <h1>Can Dogs Eat Oranges?</h1>
                <h2>Yes.</h2>
                <p>The citrusy taste may not make them a favourite with all dogs but oranges are safe for dogs to eat and a good source of vitamin C. As with all treats and new foods, remember to just give a little bit or potentially face stomach upset.

			<h1>Got a Fussy Eater? Here's 5 Dinner Toppers to Get them Salivating!</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<h2>Improve your dog's dinner by adding these health-boosting toppers!
</h2>
<p><b>CHIA SEEDS</b>: Chia has more than three times the amount of omega-3 fatty acids as salmon! It is also high in fiber, promoting healthy bowel movements and weight loss, and contains loads of iron, magnesium, and calcium, as well as phosphorus, potassium, copper, iron, and zinc. Add 1/8 teaspoon ground chia daily for every 10 pounds of body weight.<br>
<p><b>COCONUT OIL</b>: Coconut oil speeds healing, improves skin, coat, and digestion, and helps with allergies. It also supports healthy immune response, has an anti-inflammatory effect, and improves brain function—great for older dogs! Give 1/8 teaspoon for every 10 pounds of body weight daily. One to try: Oscar Newman's organic all-natural coconut products made especially for pets (cocotherapy.com).</p>
<p><b>FLAX SEEDS</b>: Flax seed, either ground or oil, is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, great for skin, coat, and a whole lot more. Additionally, flax seed (as opposed to flax seed oil) is a source of fiber. Sprinkle or drizzle 1/2 teaspoon atop your dog's dinner.</p>
<p><b>TURMERIC</b>: Turmeric (curcumin) has been shown to act in a number of ways to prevent the growth or spread of cancer cells for many different types of cancer. It works as an anti-inflammatory, an antioxidant, and helps encourage cancer cell death. Add 1/8 teaspoon daily for every 10 pounds of body weight.</p>
<p><b>FISH OIL</b>: The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are a great fix for poor skin and coat health, and, due to their anti-inflammatory properties, they play an important role in any cancer fighting regimen. Omega-3’s also promote healthy cells, joints, immune response, and cardiovascular system function, as well as brain health. Try Iceland Pure’s human-grade fish oils for dogs or DHA Gold’s sustainable marine-algae derived omega-3 sprinkle, following the dosage guide on the label. </p>
