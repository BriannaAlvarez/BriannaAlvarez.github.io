	<h2>Additive</h2>
	<p>Additive color mixing: adding red to green yields yellow; adding all three primary colors together yields white. Additive color is color created by mixing a number of different light colors, with Red, green, and blue being the primary colors normally used in additive color system.
</p>
	<h2>Subtractive</h2>
	<p>A subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes, inks, paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors, each the result of partially or completely subtracting (that is, absorbing) some wavelengths of light and not others.</p>

	<h2>Theory of Color</h2>
	<p>The theory of color is the use of primary colors to create secondary and tertiary colors.
     The color wheel is used to helped determine these colors and find their complimentary colors. </p>
	<h3>Primary</h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>	Red</li>
        <li>Blue</li>	
        <li>Yellow</li>
    
    </ol>
	<h3>Secondary</h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>Orange</li>
        <li>Green</li>
        <li>Violet</li>
    
    </ol>

	<h2>Color Models</h2>
	<p>Cathode ray tube, LCD, plasma and LED displays all utilize the RGB model. In order to create a color with RGB, three colored light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be superimposed. With no intensity,each of the three colors is perceived as black, while full intensity leads to a perception of seeing white.</p>
	<h3>Analogous</h3>
	<p>Analogous (uh-NAL-uh-gus) colors sit next to each other on the color wheel. They tend to look pleasant together because they are closely related. Orange, yellow-orange, and yellow are an example of analogous colors. They are blended nicely in Sunflowers, a painting by Vincent Van Gogh.</p>
	<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
	<p>	</p>
	<h3>Triadic</h3>
	<p>Choose one color to dominate, a second to support. The third color is used (along with black, white or gray) as an accent. A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. Triadic color harmonies tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues.</p>
	<h3>Complementary</h3>
