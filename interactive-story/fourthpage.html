<p>Despite all that she has been through, Libby has become a happy, playful girl in her loving new home. She wrestles and plays tug-of-war with her two adopted canine siblings, and she loves going out on walks and snuggling under the covers.Dogs like Libby are still suffering in laboratories. You can help by buying only cruelty-free products and letting companies that perform animal tests know why you will not be a customer. You can also donate to PETA's Investigations and Rescue fund to help us continue to investigate cruelty and seek justice for the animal victims.
